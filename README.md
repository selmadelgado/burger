# Eat da Burger!
A burger logger made with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!)

##
Eat Da Burger is a Node.js application that allows user to create burger that they love and store them via SQL database. One of the columns on the burgers table is devoured BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE. Once the user clicks the "Devour It" button on a burger, the devoured boolean on that burger is set to true. Burgers that have not yet been devoured are displayed on the left side of the screen, whereas those that have been devoured are displayed to the right.
